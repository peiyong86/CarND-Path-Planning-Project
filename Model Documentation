## Reflection
(The code model for generating paths is described in detail.)
Generally the submitted code follow the solution/suggestion from walk through video on udacity.
1, use gradually increase/decrease speed method to prevent the jerk.
2, check the distance between ego-car and other cars to prevent the collision.
3, for lane change, there are 3 steps in this project.
First, if there is a car too close in front of our car, we will try to make a lane change.
Second, find all possible target lanes. Eg, if on lane 0, target lane is 1. If on lane 1, target lane is [0,2].
Third, check if target lane is safe to change by check distance of cars on that lane.
4, for trajectory generate, we use spline (same as walk through video). Which turns out to be very smooth.
